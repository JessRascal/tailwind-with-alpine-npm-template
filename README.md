# tailwind-with-alpine-npm-template

Starting point for a Tailwindcss and Alpine.js site (using NPM).

## Getting Going

First you need to install the NPM packages.

```shell
npm install
```

Generate the Alpine.js `bundle.js`.

```shell
npm run alpinejs-dev
```

Get Tailwindcss to generate your `dist/output.css` and watch for changes.

```shell
npm start
```

Now you just need to open `index.html` using a local web server and you will see the example card.

Now you know it's working, you can replace the example card with your own code.
