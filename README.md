# tailwind-with-alpine-npm-template

Starting point for a Tailwindcss and Alpine.js site (using NPM).

## Getting Going

First you need to install the NPM packages.

```shell
npm install
```

Run it in development where everything will auto update when you make changes.

```shell
npm run dev
```

Now you just need to open `src/index.html` using a local web server and you will see the example card.

> **Note**: DON'T edit the files in `src/css` and `src/js`, these are autogenerated. Any changes made to these files will be automatically overwritten.

> **Note**: If you're using **VS Code**, I recommend using the [Live Server plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) to easily run a local web server.

---

Now you know it's working, you can replace the example card with your own code.

## Building for Production

To create a production build, just run the following:

```shell
npm run build
```

Now deploy everything in your `dist` folder.
